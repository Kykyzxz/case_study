                            <p>Bonjour, I’m Vincent van Gogh. You might know me for my swirling skies and sun-drenched fields—I painted with passion, often straight from the soul. Though my life was filled with struggle, I found beauty in the everyday: a café at night, a vase of sunflowers, the quiet of a starry evening. I didn’t sell many paintings while alive, but today, people say my art speaks louder than words. I painted not just what I saw, but what I felt. Welcome to my world—where color is emotion and brushstrokes are poetry.</p>
